## DeepLearningClassificationIntermediate

Example showing the use of a pretrained classification network together with an EdgeMatcher to inspect multiple image regions.
See also the available tutorials on the [SICK support portal](https://supportportal.sick.com/).

### Disclaimer
This sample shows the use of a licensed API and will therefore only work for a limited time on a non-licensed device/emulator.

### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.11.0 is
required. For example SIM1012 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
in AppStudio 3.0 or higher can be used.
